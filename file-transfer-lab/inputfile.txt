To be more precise, correlation and regression analysis are different types of
analyses. You use correlation analysis when you simply want to fi nd associative
relationships between distinct things, regardless of if they affect each other. For
example, there is a correlation between the sale of winter coats and gloves. When
there is a spike in sales of winter coats, there tends to be a spike in the sale of
gloves. Note that correlation does not imply causation. It is not that the purchase
of a winter coat causes or affects a buyer to purchase gloves or vice versa. It is
that a third thing, cold weather, causes the buyer to purchase both a winter coat
and gloves.
You use regression analysis when you want to uncover predictive relationships
between two things, regardless if they cause each other. By a predictive
relationship, we mean that the change in value of one variable can help you
forecast how the other variable will change. For example, you can do regression
analyses on data about the sales of winter coats and gloves. You can then create
an equation that tells you that a 15% increase in the sale of winter gloves tends
to be associated with a 20% increase in coats. Regression analysis also tells you
about the accuracy of your predictive equation.
