# File Transfer Lab
CS 4375
Blanca Galv√°n ID#88594199


Directory `file-transfer-lab` includes: 
fileClient.py, fileServer.py, stammerProxy.py and textfile.txt

*   `fileClient.py` transfers a file to the server using port 50001

*   `fileServer.py` receives a file from client -up to 100 bytes from the socket at a time- listening on port 50001

*   `stammerProxy.py` forwards tcp streams. It may delay the transmission of data but ensures all data will be forwarded, eventually.
   By default,
   it listens on port 50000 and forwards to localhost:50001.  Use the -?
   option for help.

The client-server files can be tested with or without and without the proxy

To use files without proxy: 

* 1. Open fileServer.py 
python3 fileServer.py

* 2. Open fileClient.py
python3 fileClient.py
client will immediately send textfile.txt to server, server will receive up to 100 bytes at a time
form socket and will write data to create new file

To use files with proxy: 

* 1. Open fileServer.py 
python3 fileServer.py

* 2. Open stammerProxy.py 
python3 stammerProxy.py

* 3. Open fileClient.py
python3 fileClient.py -s localhost:50001
client will immediately send textfile.txt to proxy listening on port 50000, proxy listening on port 50000 will get file and transfer to server listening on port 50001

For this lab assignment I received help from Abigail Lira to understand 
and implement the concept of "put" a file from client to server and handle different scenarios with files. Also used external resources and links for code reference and examples.
