Seek and truncate both create sparse files on 
my system (Linux + ReiserFS). They have size 
as needed but don't consume space on storage 
device in fact. So this can not be proper solution 
for fast space allocation. I have just created 100Gib 
file having only 25Gib free and still have 25Gib free 
in result.
