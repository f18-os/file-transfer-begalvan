The Arab Spring took place successfully in developing countries with an
enormous population of tech-savvy and frustrated youth. However, social mediaâ€™s
impact on security is not limited to a single part of the world. Young people
have also used social media to destabilize governments and create security
problems in stable Western countries. The most prominent example took place
barely months after the Arab Spring, in London. While many tout the Arab
Spring as the evidence of the positive impact that social media can have, most
see the London riots as the evidence of the negative.
Protests and demonstrations broke out in London after the police controversially
killed a young man and were not reprimanded. When police attempted to
disperse a demonstration concerning the killing, violence broke out, culminating
in riots and copycat riots that lasted for several days across the United Kingdom
and cost hundreds of millions of pounds in damage.
