CS 4375

Blanca Galv√°n ID# 88594199

Directory `file-transfer-lab` includes: 
fileClient.py, fileServer.py, stammerProxy.py and textfile.txt

For this lab assignment I received help from Abigail Lira to understand 
and implement the concept of "put" a file from client to server forking server to service multiple clients and handle different scenarios with files. Also used external resources and links for code reference and examples.

External resources and links for code reference, concept understanding and lab implementation:
